## How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/BlazePhenom/Mern-Project.git](https://github.com/BlazePhenom/Mern-Project.git)
    cd Mern-Project
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (`/server`):**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the server folder
    cd server
    
    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```
    * Create a file named `.env` in the `/server` folder.
    * Add the following two variables, replacing the values with your own:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
        ```
    * Start the server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    * The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend (`/client`):**
    * Open a new, separate terminal window.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the client folder
    cd client
    
    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    
    # Start the client dev server
    npm run dev
    ```
    * The frontend will open and run on `http://localhost:5173`.
